# Wellness Peak
Wellness Peak is a revolutionary platform for therapists and patients to connect. By having therapy self-evaluations be completed through our mobile-first web app, there are benefits to both parties - patients get more privacy while filling out forms, the convenience to fill these out anywhere without carrying around a folder of papers, and we kept the patient experience in mind while designing the interactive evaluations (for example, rewarding patients with points upon completing questionnaires, and logging in for multiple days consecutively).

Conversely, through our platform therapists gain access to fully customizable questionnaires that can be tailored to each patient, as we believe each patient is different from the next. In addition, all their patient data is consolidated in one place, eliminating the need to scan through hundreds of pages of therapy homework.

Built for DeltaHacks 2016.
